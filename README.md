# Exercise 1

This repository contains a Python exercise for a module of a Computer Science MSc at the University of Essex.

## Description

### Exercise 1 (exercise_1.py)

1. Write a definition for a class named Circle with attributes center and radius, where center is a Point object and radius is a number.

2. Instantiate a Circle object that represents a circle with its center at (150,100)  and radius 75.

3. Write a function named point_in_circle that takes a Circle and a Point and returns True if the Point lies in or on the boundary of the circle.

4. Write a function named rect_in_circle that takes a Circle and a Rectangle and returns True if the Rectangle lies entirely in or on the boundary of the circle.

5. Write a function named rect_circle_overlap that takes a Circle and a Rectangle and returns True if any of the corners of the Rectangle fall inside the circle. Or as a more challenging version, return True if any part of the Rectangle falls inside the circle.

### Exercise 2 (exercise_2.py)

1. In this challenge, you will create five (5) Person objects with appropriate values for first name, last name, weight, and height.

2. For this exercise, you can use the names p1, p2, p3, etc. for the names of your instantiated objects.

3. Once you have all five objects, create a list and store the objects in the list. Recall, an object is simply an instance of a user-defined type, so the syntax is the same as adding any other variable to a list.

4. Using a for loop, iterate over your list and print out the first names of each of your Person objects that you created. The output should look something like this:
    - Tom
    - Fred
    - George
    - Tanya
    - Mary

5. Step 4 will require you to think about how you will access each member of the list and then how to access the correct attribute of that object to output it with a print statement
