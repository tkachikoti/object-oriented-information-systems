# Exercise 1

This repository contains a Python exercise for a module of a Computer Science MSc at the University of Essex.

## Description

1. Write a definition for a class named Circle with attributes center and radius, where center is a Point object and radius is a number.

2. Instantiate a Circle object that represents a circle with its center at (150,100)  and radius 75.

3. Write a function named point_in_circle that takes a Circle and a Point and returns True if the Point lies in or on the boundary of the circle.

4. Write a function named rect_in_circle that takes a Circle and a Rectangle and returns True if the Rectangle lies entirely in or on the boundary of the circle.

5. Write a function named rect_circle_overlap that takes a Circle and a Rectangle and returns True if any of the corners of the Rectangle fall inside the circle. Or as a more challenging version, return True if any part of the Rectangle falls inside the circle.
